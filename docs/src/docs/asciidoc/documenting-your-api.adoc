== Documenting your API

This section provides more details about using Spring REST Docs to document your API.



[[documenting-your-api-hypermedia]]
=== Hypermedia

Spring REST Docs provides support for documenting the links in a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS[Hypermedia-based] API:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/Hypermedia.java[tag=links]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST docs to produce a snippet describing the response's links.
	Uses the static `links` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.hypermedia.HypermediaDocumentation`.
<2> Expect a link whose rel is `alpha`. Uses the static `linkWithRel` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.hypermedia.HypermediaDocumentation`.
<3> Expect a link whose rel is `bravo`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/Hypermedia.java[tag=links]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST docs to produce a snippet describing the response's links.
	Uses the static `links` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.hypermedia.HypermediaDocumentation`.
<2> Expect a link whose rel is `alpha`. Uses the static `linkWithRel` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.hypermedia.HypermediaDocumentation`.
<3> Expect a link whose rel is `bravo`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/Hypermedia.java[tag=links]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST docs to produce a snippet describing the response's links.
	Uses the static `links` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.hypermedia.HypermediaDocumentation`.
<2> Expect a link whose rel is `alpha`. Uses the static `linkWithRel` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.hypermedia.HypermediaDocumentation`.
<3> Expect a link whose rel is `bravo`.

The result is a snippet named `links.adoc` that contains a table describing the resource's
links.

TIP: If a link in the response has a `title`, the description can be omitted from its
descriptor and the `title` will be used. If you omit the description and the link does
not have a `title` a failure will occur.

When documenting links, the test will fail if an undocumented link is found in the
response. Similarly, the test will also fail if a documented link is not found in the
response and the link has not been marked as optional.

If you do not want to document a link, you can mark it as ignored. This will prevent it
from appearing in the generated snippet while avoiding the failure described above.

Links can also be documented in a relaxed mode where any undocumented links will not cause
a test failure. To do so, use the `relaxedLinks` method on
`org.springframework.restdocs.hypermedia.HypermediaDocumentation`. This can be useful when
documenting a particular scenario where you only want to focus on a subset of the links.



[[documenting-your-api-hypermedia-link-formats]]
==== Hypermedia link formats

Two link formats are understood by default:

 * Atom – links are expected to be in an array named `links`. Used by default when the
   content type of the response is compatible with `application/json`.
 * HAL – links are expected to be in a map named `_links`. Used by default when the
   content type of the response is compatible with `application/hal+json`.

If you are using Atom or HAL-format links but with a different content type you can
provide one of the built-in `LinkExtractor` implementations to `links`. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/Hypermedia.java[tag=explicit-extractor]
----
<1> Indicate that the links are in HAL format. Uses the static `halLinks` method on
`org.springframework.restdocs.hypermedia.HypermediaDocumentation`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/Hypermedia.java[tag=explicit-extractor]
----
<1> Indicate that the links are in HAL format. Uses the static `halLinks` method on
`org.springframework.restdocs.hypermedia.HypermediaDocumentation`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/Hypermedia.java[tag=explicit-extractor]
----
<1> Indicate that the links are in HAL format. Uses the static `halLinks` method on
`org.springframework.restdocs.hypermedia.HypermediaDocumentation`.

If your API represents its links in a format other than Atom or HAL, you can provide your
own implementation of the `LinkExtractor` interface to extract the links from the
response.



[[documenting-your-api-hypermedia-ignoring-common-links]]
==== Ignoring common links

Rather than documenting links that are common to every response, such as `self` and
`curies` when using HAL, you may want to document them once in an overview section and
then ignore them in the rest of your API's documentation. To do so, you can build on the
<<documenting-your-api-reusing-snippets,support for reusing snippets>> to add link
descriptors to a snippet that's preconfigured to ignore certain links. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/Hypermedia.java[tags=ignore-links]
----



[[documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads]]
=== Request and response payloads

In addition to the hypermedia-specific support <<documenting-your-api-hypermedia,described
above>>, support for general documentation of request and response payloads is also
provided.

By default, Spring REST Docs will automatically generate snippets for the body of the
request and the body of the response. These snippets are named `request-body.adoc` and
`response-body.adoc` respectively.



[[documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads-fields]]
==== Request and response fields

To provide more detailed documentation of a request or response payload, support for
documenting the payload's fields is provided.

Consider the following payload:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
	{
		"contact": {
			"name": "Jane Doe",
			"email": "jane.doe@example.com"
		}
	}
----

Its fields can be documented like this:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/Payload.java[tags=response]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST docs to produce a snippet describing the fields in the response
	payload. To document a request `requestFields` can be used. Both are static methods on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.
<2> Expect a field with the path `contact.email`. Uses the static `fieldWithPath` method
	on `org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.
<3> Expect a field with the path `contact.name`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/Payload.java[tags=response]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST docs to produce a snippet describing the fields in the response
	payload. To document a request `requestFields` can be used. Both are static methods on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.
<2> Expect a field with the path `contact.email`. Uses the static `fieldWithPath` method
	on `org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.
<3> Expect a field with the path `contact.name`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/Payload.java[tags=response]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST docs to produce a snippet describing the fields in the response
	payload. To document a request `requestFields` can be used. Both are static methods on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.
<2> Expect a field with the path `contact.email`. Uses the static `fieldWithPath` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.
<3> Expect a field with the path `contact.name`.

The result is a snippet that contains a table describing the fields. For requests this
snippet is named `request-fields.adoc`. For responses this snippet is named
`response-fields.adoc`.

When documenting fields, the test will fail if an undocumented field is found in the
payload. Similarly, the test will also fail if a documented field is not found in the
payload and the field has not been marked as optional.

If you don't want to provide detailed documentation for all of the fields, an entire
subsection of a payload can be documented. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/Payload.java[tags=subsection]
----
<1> Document the subsection with the path `contact`. `contact.email` and `contact.name`
	are now seen as having also been documented. Uses the static `subsectionWithPath`
	method on `org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/Payload.java[tags=subsection]
----
<1> Document the subsection with the path `contact`. `contact.email` and `contact.name`
	are now seen as having also been documented. Uses the static `subsectionWithPath`
	method on `org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/Payload.java[tags=subsection]
----
<1> Document the subsection with the path `contact`. `contact.email` and `contact.name`
	are now seen as having also been documented. Uses the static `subsectionWithPath`
	method on `org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.

`subsectionWithPath` can be useful for providing a high-level overview of a particular
section of a payload. Separate, more detailed documentation for a subsection can then
<<documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads-subsections, be produced>>.

If you do not want to document a field or subsection at all, you can mark it as ignored.
This will prevent it from appearing in the generated snippet while avoiding the failure
described above.

Fields can also be documented in a relaxed mode where any undocumented fields will not
cause a test failure. To do so, use the `relaxedRequestFields` and `relaxedResponseFields`
methods on
`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`. This can be useful when
documenting a particular scenario where you only want to focus on a subset of the payload.

TIP: By default, Spring REST Docs will assume that the payload you are documenting is
JSON. If you want to document an XML payload the content type of the request or response
must be compatible with `application/xml`.

[[documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads-fields-json]]
===== Fields in JSON payloads

[[documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads-fields-json-field-paths]]
====== JSON field paths

JSON field paths use either dot notation or bracket notation. Dot notation uses '.' to
separate each key in the path; `a.b`, for example. Bracket notation wraps each key in
square brackets and single quotes; `['a']['b']`, for example. In either case, `[]` is used
to identify an array. Dot notation is more concise, but using bracket notation enables the
use of `.` within a key name; `['a.b']`, for example. The two different notations can be
used in the same path; `a['b']`, for example.

With this JSON payload:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
	{
		"a":{
			"b":[
				{
					"c":"one"
				},
				{
					"c":"two"
				},
				{
					"d":"three"
				}
			],
			"e.dot" : "four"
		}
	}
----

The following paths are all present:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Path | Value

|`a`
|An object containing `b`

|`a.b`
|An array containing three objects

|`['a']['b']`
|An array containing three objects

|`a['b']`
|An array containing three objects

|`['a'].b`
|An array containing three objects

|`a.b[]`
|An array containing three objects

|`a.b[].c`
|An array containing the strings `one` and `two`

|`a.b[].d`
|The string `three`

|`a['e.dot']`
|The string `four`

|`['a']['e.dot']`
|The string `four`

|===

A payload that uses an array at its root can also be documented. The path `[]` will refer
to the entire array. You can then use bracket or dot notation to identify fields within
the array's entries. For example, `[].id` corresponds to the `id` field of every object
found in the following array:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
	[
		{
			"id":1
		},
		{
			"id":2
		}
	]
----

You can use `\*` as a wildcard to match fields with different names. For example,
`users.*.role` could be used to document the role of every user in the following JSON:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
	{
		"users":{
			"ab12cd34":{
				"role": "Administrator"
			},
			"12ab34cd":{
				"role": "Guest"
			}
		}
	}
----

[[documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads-fields-json-field-types]]
====== JSON field types

When a field is documented, Spring REST Docs will attempt to determine its type by
examining the payload. Seven different types are supported:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Type | Description

| array
| The value of each occurrence of the field is an array

| boolean
| The value of each occurrence of the field is a boolean (`true` or `false`)

| object
| The value of each occurrence of the field is an object

| number
| The value of each occurrence of the field is a number

| null
| The value of each occurrence of the field is `null`

| string
| The value of each occurrence of the field is a string

| varies
| The field occurs multiple times in the payload with a variety of different types
|===

The type can also be set explicitly using the `type(Object)` method on
`FieldDescriptor`. The result of the supplied ``Object``'s `toString` method will be used
in the documentation. Typically, one of the values enumerated by `JsonFieldType` will be
used:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/Payload.java[tags=explicit-type]
----
<1> Set the field's type to `String`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/Payload.java[tags=explicit-type]
----
<1> Set the field's type to `String`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/Payload.java[tags=explicit-type]
----
<1> Set the field's type to `String`.


[[documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads-fields-xml]]
===== XML payloads

[[documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads-fields-xml-field-paths]]
====== XML field paths

XML field paths are described using XPath. `/` is used to descend into a child node.



[[documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads-fields-xml-field-types]]
====== XML field types

When documenting an XML payload, you must provide a type for the field using the
`type(Object)` method on `FieldDescriptor`. The result of the supplied type's `toString`
method will be used in the documentation.



[[documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads-fields-reusing-field-descriptors]]
===== Reusing field descriptors

In addition to the general support for <<documenting-your-api-reusing-snippets,reusing
snippets>>, the request and response snippets allow additional descriptors to be
configured with a path prefix. This allows the descriptors for a repeated portion of a
request or response payload to be created once and then reused.

Consider an endpoint that returns a book:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
	{
		"title": "Pride and Prejudice",
		"author": "Jane Austen"
	}
----

The paths for `title` and `author` are simply `title` and `author` respectively.

Now consider an endpoint that returns an array of books:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
	[{
		"title": "Pride and Prejudice",
		"author": "Jane Austen"
	},
	{
		"title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
		"author": "Harper Lee"
	}]
----

The paths for `title` and `author` are `[].title` and `[].author` respectively. The only
difference between the single book and the array of books is that the fields' paths now
have a `[].` prefix.

The descriptors that document a book can be created:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/Payload.java[tags=book-descriptors]
----

They can then be used to document a single book:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/Payload.java[tags=single-book]
----
<1> Document `title` and `author` using existing descriptors

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/Payload.java[tags=single-book]
----
<1> Document `title` and `author` using existing descriptors

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/Payload.java[tags=single-book]
----
<1> Document `title` and `author` using existing descriptors

And an array of books:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/Payload.java[tags=book-array]
----
<1> Document the array
<2> Document `[].title` and `[].author` using the existing descriptors prefixed with `[].`

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/Payload.java[tags=book-array]
----
<1> Document the array
<2> Document `[].title` and `[].author` using the existing descriptors prefixed with `[].`

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/Payload.java[tags=book-array]
----
<1> Document the array
<2> Document `[].title` and `[].author` using the existing descriptors prefixed with `[].`

[[documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads-subsections]]
==== Documenting a subsection of a request or response payload

If a payload is large or structurally complex, it can be useful to document
individual sections of the payload. REST Docs allows you to do so by extracting a
subsection of the payload and then documenting it.

[[documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads-subsections-body]]
===== Documenting a subsection of a request or response body

Consider the following JSON response body:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
	{
		"weather": {
			"wind": {
				"speed": 15.3,
				"direction": 287.0
			},
			"temperature": {
				"high": 21.2,
				"low": 14.8
			}
		}
	}
----

A snippet that documents the `temperature` object can be produces as follows:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/Payload.java[tags=body-subsection]
----
<1> Produce a snippet containing a subsection of the response body. Uses the static
	`responseBody` and `beneathPath` methods on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`. To produce a snippet
	for the request body, `requestBody` can be used in place of `responseBody`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/Payload.java[tags=body-subsection]
----
<1> Produce a snippet containing a subsection of the response body. Uses the static
	`responseBody` and `beneathPath` methods on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`. To produce a snippet
	for the request body, `requestBody` can be used in place of `responseBody`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/Payload.java[tags=body-subsection]
----
<1> Produce a snippet containing a subsection of the response body. Uses the static
	`responseBody` and `beneathPath` methods on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`. To produce a snippet
	for the request body, `requestBody` can be used in place of `responseBody`.

The result is a snippet with the following contents:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
	{
		"temperature": {
			"high": 21.2,
			"low": 14.8
		}
	}
----

To make the snippet's name distinct, an identifier for the subsection is included. By
default, this identifier is `beneath-${path}`. For example, the code above will result in
a snippet named `response-body-beneath-weather.temperature.adoc`. The identifier can
be customized using the `withSubsectionId(String)` method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/Payload.java[tags=custom-subsection-id]
----

This example will result in a snippet named `request-body-temp.adoc`.



[[documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads-subsections-fields]]
===== Documenting the fields of a subsection of a request or response

As well as documenting a subsection of a request or response body, it's also possible to
document the fields in a particular subsection. A snippet that documents the fields of
the `temperature` object (`high` and `low`) can be produced as follows:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/Payload.java[tags=fields-subsection]
----
<1> Produce a snippet describing the fields in the subsection of the response payload
	beneath the path `weather.temperature`. Uses the static `beneathPath` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.
<2> Document the `high` and `low` fields.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/Payload.java[tags=fields-subsection]
----
<1> Produce a snippet describing the fields in the subsection of the response payload
	beneath the path `weather.temperature`. Uses the static `beneathPath` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.
<2> Document the `high` and `low` fields.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]

<1> Produce a snippet describing the fields in the subsection of the response payload
	beneath the path `weather.temperature`. Uses the static `beneathPath` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.
<2> Document the `high` and `low` fields.

The result is a snippet that contains a table describing the `high` and `low` fields
of `weather.temperature`. To make the snippet's name distinct, an identifier for the
subsection is included. By default, this identifier is `beneath-${path}`. For
example, the code above will result in a snippet named
`response-fields-beneath-weather.temperature.adoc`.



[[documenting-your-api-request-parameters]]
=== Request parameters

A request's parameters can be documented using `requestParameters`. Request parameters
can be included in a `GET` request's query string. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/RequestParameters.java[tags=request-parameters-query-string]
----
<1> Perform a `GET` request with two parameters, `page` and `per_page` in the query
	string.
<2> Configure Spring REST Docs to produce a snippet describing the request's parameters.
	Uses the static `requestParameters` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.
<3> Document the `page` parameter. Uses the static `parameterWithName` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.
<4> Document the `per_page` parameter.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/RequestParameters.java[tags=request-parameters-query-string]
----
<1> Perform a `GET` request with two parameters, `page` and `per_page` in the query
	string.
<2> Configure Spring REST Docs to produce a snippet describing the request's parameters.
	Uses the static `requestParameters` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.
<3> Document the `page` parameter. Uses the static `parameterWithName` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.
<4> Document the `per_page` parameter.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/RequestParameters.java[tags=request-parameters-query-string]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST Docs to  produce a snippet describing the request's parameters.
	Uses the static `requestParameters` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.
<2> Document the `page` parameter. Uses the static `parameterWithName` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.
<3> Document the `per_page` parameter.
<4> Perform a `GET` request with two parameters, `page` and `per_page` in the query
	string.

Request parameters can also be included as form data in the body of a POST request:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/RequestParameters.java[tags=request-parameters-form-data]
----
<1> Perform a `POST` request with a single parameter, `username`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/RequestParameters.java[tags=request-parameters-form-data]
----
<1> Perform a `POST` request with a single parameter, `username`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/RequestParameters.java[tags=request-parameters-form-data]
----
<1> Configure the `username` parameter.
<2> Perform the `POST` request.

In both cases, the result is a snippet named `request-parameters.adoc` that contains a
table describing the parameters that are supported by the resource.

When documenting request parameters, the test will fail if an undocumented request
parameter is used in the request. Similarly, the test will also fail if a documented
request parameter is not found in the request and the request parameter has not been
marked as optional.

If you do not want to document a request parameter, you can mark it as ignored. This will
prevent it from appearing in the generated snippet while avoiding the failure described
above.

Request parameters can also be documented in a relaxed mode where any undocumented
parameters will not cause a test failure. To do so, use the `relaxedRequestParameters`
method on `org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`. This can be useful
when documenting a particular scenario where you only want to focus on a subset of the
request parameters.



[[documenting-your-api-path-parameters]]
=== Path parameters

A request's path parameters can be documented using `pathParameters`. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/PathParameters.java[tags=path-parameters]
----
<1> Perform a `GET` request with two path parameters, `latitude` and `longitude`.
<2> Configure Spring REST Docs to produce a snippet describing the request's path
	parameters. Uses the static `pathParameters` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.
<3> Document the parameter named `latitude`. Uses the static `parameterWithName` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.
<4> Document the parameter named `longitude`.

	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.
<2> Document the parameter named `latitude`. Uses the static `parameterWithName` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.
<3> Document the parameter named `longitude`.
<4> Perform a `GET` request with two path parameters, `latitude` and `longitude`.

The result is a snippet named `path-parameters.adoc` that contains a table describing
the path parameters that are supported by the resource.

TIP: If you are using MockMvc then, to make the path parameters available for documentation,
the request must be built using one of the methods on `RestDocumentationRequestBuilders`
rather than `MockMvcRequestBuilders`.

When documenting path parameters, the test will fail if an undocumented path parameter
is used in the request. Similarly, the test will also fail if a documented path parameter
is not found in the request and the path parameter has not been marked as optional.

Path parameters can also be documented in a relaxed mode where any undocumented
parameters will not cause a test failure. To do so, use the `relaxedPathParameters`
method on `org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`. This can be useful
when documenting a particular scenario where you only want to focus on a subset of the
path parameters.

If you do not want to document a path parameter, you can mark it as ignored. This will
prevent it from appearing in the generated snippet while avoiding the failure described
above.



[[documenting-your-api-request-parts]]
=== Request parts

The parts of a multipart request can be documenting using `requestParts`. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/RequestParts.java[tags=request-parts]
----
<1> Perform a `POST` request with a single part named `file`.
<2> Configure Spring REST Docs to produce a snippet describing the request's parts. Uses
	the static `requestParts` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.
<3> Document the part named `file`. Uses the static `partWithName` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/RequestParts.java[tags=request-parts]
----
<1> Perform a `POST` request with a single part named `file`.
<2> Configure Spring REST Docs to produce a snippet describing the request's parts. Uses
	the static `requestParts` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.
<3> Document the part named `file`. Uses the static `partWithName` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/RequestParts.java[tags=request-parts]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST Docs to produce a snippet describing the request's parts. Uses
	the static `requestParts` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.
<2> Document the part named `file`. Uses the static `partWithName` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`.
<3> Configure the request with the part named `file`.
<4> Perform the `POST` request to `/upload`.

The result is a snippet named `request-parts.adoc` that contains a table describing the
request parts that are supported by the resource.

When documenting request parts, the test will fail if an undocumented part is used in the
request. Similarly, the test will also fail if a documented part is not found in the
request and the part has not been marked as optional.

Request parts can also be documented in a relaxed mode where any undocumented
parts will not cause a test failure. To do so, use the `relaxedRequestParts` method on
`org.springframework.restdocs.request.RequestDocumentation`. This can be useful
when documenting a particular scenario where you only want to focus on a subset of the
request parts.

If you do not want to document a request part, you can mark it as ignored. This will
prevent it from appearing in the generated snippet while avoiding the failure described
above.


[[documenting-your-api-request-parts-payloads]]
=== Request part payloads

The payload of a request part can be documented in much the same way as the
<<documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads,payload of a request>> with support
for documenting a request part's body and its fields.



[[documenting-your-api-request-parts-payloads-body]]
==== Documenting a request part's body

A snippet containing the body of a request part can be generated:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/RequestPartPayload.java[tags=body]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST docs to produce a snippet containing the body of the
	of the request part named `metadata`. Uses the static `requestPartBody` method on
	`PayloadDocumentation`.
	payload.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/RequestPartPayload.java[tags=body]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST docs to produce a snippet containing the body of the
	of the request part named `metadata`. Uses the static `requestPartBody` method on
	`PayloadDocumentation`.
	payload.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/RequestPartPayload.java[tags=body]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST docs to produce a snippet containing the body of the request
	part named `metadata`. Uses the static `requestPartBody` method on
	`PayloadDocumentation`.

The result is a snippet `request-part-${part-name}-body.adoc` that contains the part's
body. For example, documenting a part named `metadata` will produce a snippet named
`request-part-metadata-body.adoc`.



[[documenting-your-api-request-parts-payloads-fields]]
==== Documenting a request part's fields

A request part's fields can be documented in much the same way as the fields of a request
or response:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/RequestPartPayload.java[tags=fields]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST docs to produce a snippet describing the fields in the payload
	of the request part named `metadata`. Uses the static `requestPartFields` method on
	`PayloadDocumentation`.
	payload.
<2> Expect a field with the path `version`. Uses the static `fieldWithPath` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/RequestPartPayload.java[tags=fields]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST docs to produce a snippet describing the fields in the payload
	of the request part named `metadata`. Uses the static `requestPartFields` method on
	`PayloadDocumentation`.
	payload.
<2> Expect a field with the path `version`. Uses the static `fieldWithPath` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/RequestPartPayload.java[tags=fields]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST docs to produce a snippet describing the fields in the payload
	of the request part named `metadata`. Uses the static `requestPartFields` method on
	`PayloadDocumentation`.
<2> Expect a field with the path `version`. Uses the static `fieldWithPath` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`.

The result is a snippet that contains a table describing the part's fields. This snippet
is named `request-part-${part-name}-fields.adoc`. For example, documenting a part named
`metadata` will produce a snippet named `request-part-metadata-fields.adoc`.

When documenting fields, the test will fail if an undocumented field is found in the
payload of the part. Similarly, the test will also fail if a documented field is not found
in the payload of the part and the field has not been marked as optional. For payloads
with a hierarchical structure, documenting a field is sufficient for all of its
descendants to also be treated as having been documented.

If you do not want to document a field, you can mark it as ignored. This will prevent it
from appearing in the generated snippet while avoiding the failure described above.

Fields can also be documented in a relaxed mode where any undocumented fields will not
cause a test failure. To do so, use the `relaxedRequestPartFields` method on
`org.springframework.restdocs.payload.PayloadDocumentation`. This can be useful when
documenting a particular scenario where you only want to focus on a subset of the payload
of the part.

For further information on describing fields, documenting payloads that use XML,
and more please refer to the
<<documenting-your-api-request-response-payloads,section on documenting request and
response payloads>>.

[[documenting-your-api-http-headers]]
=== HTTP headers

The headers in a request or response can be documented using `requestHeaders` and
`responseHeaders` respectively. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/HttpHeaders.java[tags=headers]
----
<1> Perform a `GET` request with an `Authorization` header that uses basic authentication
<2> Configure Spring REST Docs to produce a snippet describing the request's headers.
	Uses the static `requestHeaders` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.headers.HeaderDocumentation`.
<3> Document the `Authorization` header. Uses the static `headerWithName` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.headers.HeaderDocumentation`.
<4> Produce a snippet describing the response's headers. Uses the static `responseHeaders`
	method on `org.springframework.restdocs.headers.HeaderDocumentation`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/HttpHeaders.java[tags=headers]
----
<1> Perform a `GET` request with an `Authorization` header that uses basic authentication
<2> Configure Spring REST Docs to produce a snippet describing the request's headers.
	Uses the static `requestHeaders` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.headers.HeaderDocumentation`.
<3> Document the `Authorization` header. Uses the static `headerWithName` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.headers.HeaderDocumentation`.
<4> Produce a snippet describing the response's headers. Uses the static `responseHeaders`
	method on `org.springframework.restdocs.headers.HeaderDocumentation`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/HttpHeaders.java[tags=headers]
----
<1> Configure Spring REST Docs to produce a snippet describing the request's headers.
	Uses the static `requestHeaders` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.headers.HeaderDocumentation`.
<2> Document the `Authorization` header. Uses the static `headerWithName` method on
	`org.springframework.restdocs.headers.HeaderDocumentation.
<3> Produce a snippet describing the response's headers. Uses the static `responseHeaders`
	method on `org.springframework.restdocs.headers.HeaderDocumentation`.
<4> Configure the request with an `Authorization` header that uses basic authentication

The result is a snippet named `request-headers.adoc` and a snippet named
`response-headers.adoc`. Each contains a table describing the headers.

When documenting HTTP Headers, the test will fail if a documented header is not found in
the request or response.



[[documenting-your-api-reusing-snippets]]
=== Reusing snippets

It's common for an API that's being documented to have some features that are common
across several of its resources. To avoid repetition when documenting such resources a
`Snippet` configured with the common elements can be reused.

First, create the `Snippet` that describes the common elements. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/SnippetReuse.java[tags=field]
----

Second, use this snippet and add further descriptors that are resource-specific. For
example:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/MockMvcSnippetReuse.java[tags=use]
----
<1> Reuse the `pagingLinks` `Snippet` calling `and` to add descriptors that are specific
	to the resource that is being documented.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/WebTestClientSnippetReuse.java[tags=use]
----
<1> Reuse the `pagingLinks` `Snippet` calling `and` to add descriptors that are specific
	to the resource that is being documented.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/RestAssuredSnippetReuse.java[tags=use]
----
<1> Reuse the `pagingLinks` `Snippet` calling `and` to add descriptors that are specific
	to the resource that is being documented.

The result of the example is that links with the rels `first`, `last`, `next`, `previous`,
`alpha`, and `bravo` are all documented.



[[documenting-your-api-constraints]]
=== Documenting constraints

Spring REST Docs provides a number of classes that can help you to document constraints.
An instance of `ConstraintDescriptions` can be used to access descriptions of a class's
constraints. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/Constraints.java[tags=constraints]
----
<1> Create an instance of `ConstraintDescriptions` for the `UserInput` class
<2> Get the descriptions of the name property's constraints. This list will contain two
	descriptions; one for the `NotNull` constraint and one for the `Size` constraint.

The {samples}/rest-notes-spring-hateoas/src/test/java/com/example/notes/ApiDocumentation.java[`ApiDocumentation`]
class in the Spring HATEOAS sample shows this functionality in action.



[[documenting-your-api-constraints-finding]]
==== Finding constraints

By default, constraints are found using a Bean Validation `Validator`. Currently, only
property constraints are supported. You can customize the `Validator` that's used by
creating `ConstraintDescriptions` with a custom `ValidatorConstraintResolver` instance.
To take complete control of constraint resolution, your own implementation of
`ConstraintResolver` can be used.



[[documenting-your-api-constraints-describing]]
==== Describing constraints

Default descriptions are provided for all of the Bean Validation 1.1's constraints:

* AssertFalse
* AssertTrue
* DecimalMax
* DecimalMin
* Digits
* Future
* Max
* Min
* NotNull
* Null
* Past
* Pattern
* Size

Default descriptions are also provided for constraints from Hibernate Validator:

* CreditCardNumber
* EAN
* Email
* Length
* LuhnCheck
* Mod10Check
* Mod11Check
* NotBlank
* NotEmpty
* Range
* SafeHtml
* URL

To override the default descriptions, or to provide a new description, create a resource
bundle with the base name
`org.springframework.restdocs.constraints.ConstraintDescriptions`.  The Spring
HATEOAS-based sample contains
{samples}/rest-notes-spring-hateoas/src/test/resources/org/springframework/restdocs/constraints/ConstraintDescriptions.properties[an
example of such a resource bundle].

Each key in the resource bundle is the fully-qualified name of a constraint plus
`.description`. For example, the key for the standard `@NotNull` constraint is
`javax.validation.constraints.NotNull.description`.

Property placeholder's referring to a constraint's attributes can be used in its
description. For example, the default description of the `@Min` constraint,
`Must be at least ${value}`, refers to the constraint's `value` attribute.

To take more control of constraint description resolution, create `ConstraintDescriptions`
with a custom `ResourceBundleConstraintDescriptionResolver`. To take complete control,
create `ConstraintDescriptions` with a custom `ConstraintDescriptionResolver`
implementation.



==== Using constraint descriptions in generated snippets

Once you have a constraint's descriptions, you're free to use them however you like in
the generated snippets. For example, you may want to include the constraint descriptions
as part of a field's description. Alternatively, you could include the constraints as
<<documenting-your-api-customizing-including-extra-information, extra information>> in
the request fields snippet. The
{samples}/rest-notes-spring-hateoas/src/test/java/com/example/notes/ApiDocumentation.java[`ApiDocumentation`]
class in the Spring HATEOAS-based sample illustrates the latter approach.



[[documenting-your-api-default-snippets]]
=== Default snippets

A number of snippets are produced automatically when you document a request and response.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Snippet | Description

| `curl-request.adoc`
| Contains the http://curl.haxx.se[`curl`] command that is equivalent to the `MockMvc`
call that is being documented

| `httpie-request.adoc`
| Contains the http://httpie.org[`HTTPie`] command that is equivalent to the `MockMvc`
call that is being documented

| `http-request.adoc`
| Contains the HTTP request that is equivalent to the `MockMvc` call that is being
documented

| `http-response.adoc`
| Contains the HTTP response that was returned

| `request-body.adoc`
| Contains the body of the request that was sent

| `response-body.adoc`
| Contains the body of the response that was returned

|===

You can configure which snippets are produced by default. Please refer to the
<<configuration, configuration section>> for more information.



[[documentating-your-api-parameterized-output-directories]]
=== Using parameterized output directories

When using MockMvc or REST Assured, the output directory used by `document` can be
parameterized. The output directory cannot be parameterized when using WebTestClient.

The following parameters are supported:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Parameter | Description

| {methodName}
| The unmodified name of the test method

| {method-name}
| The name of the test method, formatted using kebab-case

| {method_name}
| The name of the test method, formatted using snake_case

| {ClassName}
| The unmodified simple name of the test class

| {class-name}
| The simple name of the test class, formatted using kebab-case

| {class_name}
| The simple name of the test class, formatted using snake_case

| {step}
| The count of calls made to the service in the current test
|===

For example, `document("{class-name}/{method-name}")` in a test method named
`creatingANote` on the test class `GettingStartedDocumentation`, will write
snippets into a directory named `getting-started-documentation/creating-a-note`.

A parameterized output directory is particularly useful in combination with an `@Before`
method. It allows documentation to be configured once in a setup method and then reused
in every test in the class:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/ParameterizedOutput.java[tags=parameterized-output]
----

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/ParameterizedOutput.java[tags=parameterized-output]
----

With this configuration in place, every call to the service you are testing will produce
the <<documenting-your-api-default-snippets,default snippets>> without any further
configuration. Take a look at the `GettingStartedDocumentation` classes in each of the
sample applications to see this functionality in action.



[[documenting-your-api-customizing]]
=== Customizing the output



[[documenting-your-api-customizing-snippets]]
==== Customizing the generated snippets
Spring REST Docs uses https://mustache.github.io[Mustache] templates to produce the
generated snippets.
{source}/spring-restdocs-core/src/main/resources/org/springframework/restdocs/templates[Default
templates] are provided for each of the snippets that Spring REST Docs can produce. To
customize a snippet's content, you can provide your own template.

Templates are loaded from the classpath from an `org.springframework.restdocs.templates`
subpackage. The name of the subpackage is determined by the ID of the template format
that is in use. The default template format, Asciidoctor, has the ID `asciidoctor` so
snippets are loaded from `org.springframework.restdocs.templates.asciidoctor`. Each
template is named after the snippet that it will produce. For example, to
override the template for the `curl-request.adoc` snippet, create a template named
`curl-request.snippet` in
`src/test/resources/org/springframework/restdocs/templates/asciidoctor`.



[[documenting-your-api-customizing-including-extra-information]]
==== Including extra information

There are two ways to provide extra information for inclusion in a generated snippet:

. Use the `attributes` method on a descriptor to add one or more attributes to it.
. Pass in some attributes when calling `curlRequest`, `httpRequest`, `httpResponse`, etc.
  Such attributes will be associated with the snippet as a whole.

Any additional attributes are made available during the template rendering process.
Coupled with a custom snippet template, this makes it possible to include extra
information in a generated snippet.

A concrete example of the above is the addition of a constraints column and a title when
documenting request fields. The first step is to provide a `constraints` attribute for
each field that you are documenting and to provide a `title` attribute:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/Payload.java[tags=constraints]
----
<1> Configure the `title` attribute for the request fields snippet
<2> Set the `constraints` attribute for the `name` field
<3> Set the `constraints` attribute for the `email` field

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/Payload.java[tags=constraints]
----
<1> Configure the `title` attribute for the request fields snippet
<2> Set the `constraints` attribute for the `name` field
<3> Set the `constraints` attribute for the `email` field

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/Payload.java[tags=constraints]
----
<1> Configure the `title` attribute for the request fields snippet
<2> Set the `constraints` attribute for the `name` field
<3> Set the `constraints` attribute for the `email` field

The second step is to provide a custom template named `request-fields.snippet` that
includes the information about the fields' constraints in the generated snippet's table
and adds a title:

[source,indent=0]
----
	.{{title}} <1>
	|===
	|Path|Type|Description|Constraints <2>

	{{#fields}}
	|{{path}}
	|{{type}}
	|{{description}}
	|{{constraints}} <3>

	{{/fields}}
	|===
----
<1> Add a title to the table
<2> Add a new column named "Constraints"
<3> Include the descriptors' `constraints` attribute in each row of the table
