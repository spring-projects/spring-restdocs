== Customizing requests and responses

There may be situations where you do not want to document a request exactly as it was sent or a response exactly as it was received.
Spring REST Docs provides a number of preprocessors that can be used to modify a request or response before it is documented.

Preprocessing is configured by calling `document` with an `OperationRequestPreprocessor` or an `OperationResponsePreprocessor`.
You can obtain instances by using the static `preprocessRequest` and `preprocessResponse` methods on `Preprocessors`.
The following examples show how to do so:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/PerTestPreprocessing.java[tags=preprocessing]
----
<1> Apply a request preprocessor that removes the header named `Foo`.
<2> Apply a response preprocessor that pretty prints its content.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/PerTestPreprocessing.java[tags=preprocessing]
----
<1> Apply a request preprocessor that removes the header named `Foo`.
<2> Apply a response preprocessor that pretty prints its content.

.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/PerTestPreprocessing.java[tags=preprocessing]
----
<1> Apply a request preprocessor that removes the header named `Foo`.
<2> Apply a response preprocessor that pretty prints its content.
====

Alternatively, you may want to apply the same preprocessors to every test.
You can do so by using the `RestDocumentationConfigurer` API in your `@Before` method to configure the preprocessors.
For example, to remove the `Foo` header from all requests and pretty print all responses, you could do one of the following (depending on your testing environment):

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/EveryTestPreprocessing.java[tags=setup]
----
<1> Apply a request preprocessor that removes the header named `Foo`.
<2> Apply a response preprocessor that pretty prints its content.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/EveryTestPreprocessing.java[tags=setup]
----
<1> Apply a request preprocessor that removes the header named `Foo`.
<2> Apply a response preprocessor that pretty prints its content.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/EveryTestPreprocessing.java[tags=setup]
----
<1> Apply a request preprocessor that removes the header named `Foo`.
<2> Apply a response preprocessor that pretty prints its content.

Then, in each test, you can perform any configuration specific to that test.
The following examples show how to do so:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/EveryTestPreprocessing.java[tags=use]
----

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.WebTestClient
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/webtestclient/EveryTestPreprocessing.java[tags=use]
----

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/EveryTestPreprocessing.java[tags=use]
----

Various built-in preprocessors, including those illustrated above, are available through the static methods on `Preprocessors`.
See <<Preprocessors, below>> for further details.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors]]
=== Preprocessors



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-pretty-print]]
==== Pretty Printing

`prettyPrint` on `Preprocessors` formats the content of the request or response to make it easier to read.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-mask-links]]
==== Masking Links

If you are documenting a hypermedia-based API, you may want to encourage clients to navigate the API by using links rather than through the use of hard coded URIs.
One way to do so is to limit the use of URIs in the documentation.
`maskLinks` on `Preprocessors` replaces the `href` of any links in the response with `...`.
You can also specify a different replacement if you wish.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-remove-headers]]
==== Removing Headers

`removeHeaders` on `Preprocessors` removes any headers from the request or response where the name is equal to any of the given header names.

`removeMatchingHeaders` on `Preprocessors` removes any headers from the request or response where the name matches any of the given regular expression patterns.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-replace-patterns]]
==== Replacing Patterns

`replacePattern` on `Preprocessors` provides a general purpose mechanism for replacing content in a request or response.
Any occurrences that match a regular expression are replaced.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-modify-headers]]
==== Modifying Headers

You can use `modifyHeaders` on `Preprocessors` to add, set, and remove request or response headers.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-modify-request-parameters]]
==== Modifying Request Parameters

You can use `modifyParameters` on `Preprocessors` to add, set, and remove request parameters.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-modify-uris]]
==== Modifying URIs

TIP: If you use MockMvc or a WebTestClient that is not bound to a server, you should customize URIs by <<configuration-uris, changing the configuration>>.

You can use `modifyUris` on `Preprocessors` to modify any URIs in a request or a response.
When using REST Assured or WebTestClient bound to a server, this lets you customize the URIs that appear in the documentation while testing a local instance of the service.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-writing-your-own]]
==== Writing Your Own Preprocessor

If one of the built-in preprocessors does not meet your needs, you can write your own by implementing the `OperationPreprocessor` interface.
You can then use your custom preprocessor in exactly the same way as any of the built-in preprocessors.

If you want to modify only the content (body) of a request or response, consider implementing the `ContentModifier` interface and using it with the built-in `ContentModifyingOperationPreprocessor`.
