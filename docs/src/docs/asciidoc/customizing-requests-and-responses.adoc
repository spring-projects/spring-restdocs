== Customizing requests and responses

There may be situations where you do not want to document a request exactly as it was sent
or a response exactly as it was received. Spring REST Docs provides a number of
preprocessors that can be used to modify a request or response before it's documented.

Preprocessing is configured by calling `document` with an `OperationRequestPreprocessor`,
and/or an `OperationResponsePreprocessor`. Instances can be obtained using the
static `preprocessRequest` and `preprocessResponse` methods on `Preprocessors`. For
example:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/PerTestPreprocessing.java[tags=preprocessing]
----
<1> Apply a request preprocessor that will remove the header named `Foo`.
<2> Apply a response preprocessor that will pretty print its content.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/PerTestPreprocessing.java[tags=preprocessing]
----
<1> Apply a request preprocessor that will remove the header named `Foo`.
<2> Apply a response preprocessor that will pretty print its content.

Alternatively, you may want to apply the same preprocessors to every test. You can do
so by configuring the preprocessors in your `@Before` method and using the
<<documentating-your-api-parameterized-output-directories, support for parameterized
output directories>>:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/EveryTestPreprocessing.java[tags=setup]
----
<1> Create a `RestDocumentationResultHandler`, configured to preprocess the request
	and response.
<2> Create a `MockMvc` instance, configured to always call the documentation result
	handler.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/EveryTestPreprocessing.java[tags=setup]
----
<1> Create a `RestDocumentationFilter`, configured to preprocess the request
	and response.
<2> Create a `RequestSpecification` instance, configured to always call the documentation
	filter.

Then, in each test, any configuration specific to that test can be performed. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/EveryTestPreprocessing.java[tags=use]
----
<1> Document the links specific to the resource that is being tested
<2> The request and response will be preprocessed due to the use of `alwaysDo` above.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/EveryTestPreprocessing.java[tags=use]
----
<1> Document the links specific to the resource that is being tested
<2> The request and response will be preprocessed due to the configuration of the
`RequestSpecification` in the `setUp` method.

Various built in preprocessors, including those illustrated above, are available via the
static methods on `Preprocessors`. See <<Preprocessors, below>> for further details.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors]]
=== Preprocessors



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-pretty-print]]
==== Pretty printing

`prettyPrint` on `Preprocessors` formats the content of the request or response
to make it easier to read.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-mask-links]]
==== Masking links

If you're documenting a Hypermedia-based API, you may want to encourage clients to
navigate the API using links rather than through the use of hard coded URIs. One way to do
this is to limit the use of URIs in the documentation. `maskLinks` on
`Preprocessors` replaces the `href` of any links in the response with `...`. A
different replacement can also be specified if you wish.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-remove-headers]]
==== Removing headers

`removeHeaders` on `Preprocessors` removes any occurrences of the named headers
from the request or response.

`removeMatchingHeaders` on `Preprocessors` applies the given patterns on every header and
removes them when matching.


[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-replace-patterns]]
==== Replacing patterns

`replacePattern` on `Preprocessors` provides a general purpose mechanism for
replacing content in a request or response. Any occurrences of a regular expression are
replaced.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-modify-uris]]
==== Modifying URIs

TIP: If you are using MockMvc, URIs should be customized by <<configuration-uris, changing
the configuration>>.

`modifyUris` on `RestAssuredPreprocessors` can be used to modify any URIs in a request
or a response. When using REST Assured, this allows you to customize the URIs that appear
in the documentation while testing a local instance of the service.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-writing-your-own]]
==== Writing your own preprocessor

If one of the built-in preprocessors does not meet your needs, you can write your own by
implementing the `OperationPreprocessor` interface. You can then use your custom
preprocessor in exactly the same way as any of the built-in preprocessors.

If you only want to modify the content (body) of a request or response, consider
implementing the `ContentModifier` interface and using it with the built-in
`ContentModifyingOperationPreprocessor`.
