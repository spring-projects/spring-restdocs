[[getting-started-requirements]]
=== Requirements

Spring REST Docs has the following minimum requirements:

- Java 7
- Spring Framework 4.2

Additionally, the `spring-restdocs-restassured` module has the following minimum
requirements:

- REST Assured 2.8

[[getting-started-build-configuration]]
=== Build configuration

The first step in using Spring REST Docs is to configure your project's build. The
{samples}/rest-notes-spring-hateoas[Spring HATEOAS] and
{samples}/rest-notes-spring-data-rest[Spring Data REST] samples contain a `build.gradle`
and `pom.xml` respectively that you may wish to use as a reference. The key parts of
the configuration are described below.

[[getting-started-build-configuration-gradle-packaging-the-documentation]]
==== Packaging the documentation

You may want to package the generated documentation in your project's jar file, for
example to have it {spring-boot-docs}/#boot-features-spring-mvc-static-content[served as
static content] by Spring Boot. To do so, configure your project's build so that:

1. The documentation is generated before the jar is built
2. The generated documentation is included in the jar

[source,xml,indent=0,role="primary"]
.Maven

	<plugin> <1>
		<groupId>org.asciidoctor</groupId>
		<artifactId>asciidoctor-maven-plugin</artifactId>

			</execution>
		</executions>
	</plugin>
----
<1> The existing declaration for the Asciidoctor plugin.
<2> The resource plugin must be declared after the Asciidoctor plugin as they are bound
to the same phase (`prepare-package`) and the resource plugin must run after the
Asciidoctor plugin to ensure that the documentation is generated before it's copied.
<3> Copy the generated documentation into the build output's `static/docs` directory,
from where it will be included in the jar file.

[source,groovy,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
	jar {
		dependsOn asciidoctor <1>
		from ("${asciidoctor.outputDir}/html5") { <2>
			into 'static/docs'
		}
	}
----
<1> Ensure that the documentation has been generated before the jar is built.
<2> Copy the generated documentation into the jar's `static/docs` directory.



[[getting-started-documentation-snippets]]
=== Generating documentation snippets
Spring REST Docs uses
{spring-framework-docs}/#spring-mvc-test-framework[Spring's MVC Test framework] or
http://www.rest-assured.io[REST Assured] to make requests to the service that you are
documenting. It then produces documentation snippets for the request and the resulting
response.



[[getting-started-documentation-snippets-setup]]
==== Setting up your tests

Exactly how you setup your tests depends on the test framework that you're using.
Spring REST Docs provides first-class support for JUnit. Other frameworks, such as TestNG,
are also supported although slightly more setup is required.

[[getting-started-documentation-snippets-setup-junit]]
===== Setting up your JUnit tests

When using JUnit, the first step in generating documentation snippets is to declare a
`public` `JUnitRestDocumentation` field that's annotated as a JUnit `@Rule`. The
`JUnitRestDocumentation` rule is configured with the output directory into which generated
snippets should be written. This output directory should match the snippets directory that
you have configured in your `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` file.

For Maven (`pom.xml`) that will typically be `target/generated-snippets` and for
Gradle (`build.gradle`) it will typically be `build/generated-snippets`:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.Maven
----
@Rule
public JUnitRestDocumentation restDocumentation =
		new JUnitRestDocumentation("target/generated-snippets");
----

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
@Rule
public JUnitRestDocumentation restDocumentation =
		new JUnitRestDocumentation("build/generated-snippets");
----

Next, provide an `@Before` method to configure MockMvc or REST Assured:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/ExampleApplicationTests.java[tags=setup]
----
<1> The `MockMvc` instance is configured using a `MockMvcRestDocumentationConfigurer`. An
instance of this class can be obtained from the static `documentationConfiguration()`
method on `org.springframework.restdocs.mockmvc.MockMvcRestDocumentation`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/ExampleApplicationTests.java[tags=setup]
----
<1> REST Assured is configured by adding a `RestAssuredRestDocumentationConfigurer` as a
`Filter`. An instance of this class can be obtained from the static
`documentationConfiguration()` method on
`org.springframework.restdocs.restassured.RestAssuredRestDocumentation`.

The configurer applies sensible defaults and also provides an API for customizing the
configuration. Refer to the <<configuration, configuration section>> for more information.



===== Setting up your tests without JUnit
[[getting-started-documentation-snippets-setup-manual]]

The configuration when JUnit is not being used is largely similar to when it is being
used. This section describes the key differences. The {samples}/testng[TestNG sample] also
illustrates the approach.

The first difference is that `ManualRestDocumentation` should be used in place of
`JUnitRestDocumentation` and there's no need for the `@Rule` annotation:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.Maven
----
private ManualRestDocumentation restDocumentation =
		new ManualRestDocumentation("target/generated-snippets");
----

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
private ManualRestDocumentation restDocumentation =
		new ManualRestDocumentation("build/generated-snippets");
----

Secondly, `ManualRestDocumentation.beforeTest(Class, String)`
must be called before each test. This can be done as part of the method that is
configuring MockMVC or REST Assured:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/ExampleApplicationTestNgTests.java[tags=setup]
----

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/ExampleApplicationTestNgTests.java[tags=setup]
----

Lastly, `ManualRestDocumentation.afterTest` must be called after each test. For example,
with TestNG:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/ExampleApplicationTestNgTests.java[tags=teardown]
----

[[getting-started-documentation-snippets-invoking-the-service]]
==== Invoking the RESTful service

Now that the testing framework has been configured, it can be used to invoke the RESTful
service and document the request and response. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.MockMvc
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/InvokeService.java[tags=invoke-service]
----
<1> Invoke the root (`/`) of the service and indicate that an `application/json` response
is required.
<2> Assert that the service produced the expected response.
<3> Document the call to the service, writing the snippets into a directory named `index`
that will be located beneath the configured output directory. The snippets are written by
a `RestDocumentationResultHandler`. An instance of this class can be obtained from the
static `document` method on
`org.springframework.restdocs.mockmvc.MockMvcRestDocumentation`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.REST Assured
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/InvokeService.java[tags=invoke-service]
----
<1> Apply the specification that was initialised in the `@Before` method.
<2> Indicate that an `application/json` response is required.
<3> Document the call to the service, writing the snippets into a directory named `index`
that will be located beneath the configured output directory. The snippets are written by
a `RestDocumentationFilter`. An instance of this class can be obtained from the
static `document` method on
`org.springframework.restdocs.restassured.RestAssuredRestDocumentation`.
<4> Invoke the root (`/`) of the service.
<5> Assert that the service produce the expected response.

By default, four snippets are written:

 * `<output-directory>/index/curl-request.adoc`
 * `<output-directory>/index/http-request.adoc`
 * `<output-directory>/index/http-response.adoc`
 * `<output-directory>/index/httpie-request.adoc`

Refer to <<documenting-your-api>> for more information about these and other snippets
that can be produced by Spring REST Docs.



[[getting-started-using-the-snippets]]
=== Using the snippets

Before using the generated snippets from above, an ```\*.adoc``` source file must be manually created.
Its filename does not matter for either of the two build tools' Asciidoctor plugins mentioned
above and will also be the name of the finally generated ```*.html``` file.
For the exact locations refer to the following table.

[cols="2,5,8"]
|===
| Build tool | Source files | Generated files

| Maven
| ```src/main/asciidoc/*.adoc```
| ```${project.build.directory}/generated-docs/*.html```

| Gradle
| ```src/docs/asciidoc/*.adoc```
| ```$buildDir/asciidoc/*.html```

|===

The generated snippets can then be included in the manually created Asciidoctor file from above using the
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#include-files[include macro].
The `snippets` attribute specified in the <<getting-started-build-configuration, build
configuration>> can be used to reference the snippets output directory. For example:

[source,adoc,indent=0]
----
\include::{snippets}/index/curl-request.adoc[]
----
