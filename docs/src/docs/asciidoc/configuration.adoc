[[configuration-uris]]
=== Documented URIs

The default configuration for URIs documented by Spring REST Docs is:

|===
|Setting |Default

|Scheme
|`http`

|Host
|`localhost`

|Port
|`8080`

|Context path
|Empty string
|===

This configuration is applied by `RestDocumentationConfigurer`. You can use its API to
change one or more of the defaults to suit your needs:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/CustomUriConfiguration.java[tags=custom-uri-configuration]
----



[[configuration-snippet-encoding]]
=== Snippet encoding

The default encoding used by Asciidoctor is `UTF-8`. Spring REST Docs adopts the same
default for the snippets that it generated. If you require an encoding other than `UTF-8`,
use `RestDocumentationConfigurer` to configure it:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/CustomEncoding.java[tags=custom-encoding]
----



[[configuration-output-directory]]
=== Snippet output directory

As described in <<getting-started-build-configuration>> the snippet output directory is
configured in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file. This configuration applies to builds
on the command line, but it may not apply when running your tests in your IDE. In the
absence of the property, Spring REST Docs will write the generated snippets to standard
out.

If you'd prefer that your IDE writes the snippets to disk you can use a file in
`src/test/resources` named `documentation.properties` to specify the output directory that
should be used:

[source,properties]
----
org.springframework.restdocs.outputDir: target/generated-snippets
----
