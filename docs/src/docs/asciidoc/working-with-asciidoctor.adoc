[[working-with-asciidoctor-including-snippets]]
=== Including snippets

The  http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#include-files[include
macro] is used to include generated snippets in your documentation. The `snippets`
attribute specified in the <<getting-started-build-configuration, build configuration>>
can be used to reference the snippets output directory, for example:

[source,adoc,indent=0]
----
\include::{snippets}/index/curl-request.adoc[]
----



[[working-with-asciidoctor-customizing-tables]]
=== Customizing tables

Many of the snippets contain a table in its default configuration. The appearance of the
table can be customized by providing some additional configuration when the snippet is
included.



[[working-with-asciidoctor-customizing-tables-formatting-columns]]
==== Formatting columns

Asciidoctor has rich support for
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#cols-format[formatting a table's columns]. For
example, the widths of a table's columns can be specified using the `cols` attribute:

[source,adoc,indent=0]
----
[cols=1,3] <1>
\include::{snippets}/index/links.adoc[]
----
<1> The table's width will be split across its two columns with the second column being
three times as wide as the first.



[[working-with-asciidoctor-customizing-tables-title]]
==== Configuring the title

The title of a table can be specified using a line prefixed by a `.`:

[source,adoc,indent=0]
----
.Links <1>
\include::{snippets}/index/links.adoc[]
----
<1> The table's title will be `Links`.
