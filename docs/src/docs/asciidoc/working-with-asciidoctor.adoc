relevant to Spring REST Docs.

[[working-with-asciidoctor-including-snippets]]
=== Including snippets

The http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#include-files[include
macro] is used to include generated snippets in your documentation. The `snippets`
attribute that is automatically set by `spring-restdocs-asciidoctor` configured in the
<<getting-started-build-configuration, build configuration>> can be used to reference the
snippets output directory. For example:

[source,indent=0]
----
\include::{snippets}/index/curl-request.adoc[]
----



[[working-with-asciidoctor-customizing-tables]]
=== Customizing tables

Many of the snippets contain a table in its default configuration. The appearance of the
table can be customized, either by providing some additional configuration when the
snippet is included or by using a custom snippet template.



[[working-with-asciidoctor-customizing-tables-formatting-columns]]
==== Formatting columns

Asciidoctor has rich support for
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#cols-format[formatting a table's columns]. For
example, the widths of a table's columns can be specified using the `cols` attribute:

[source,indent=0]
----
[cols=1,3] <1>
\include::{snippets}/index/links.adoc[]
----
<1> The table's width will be split across its two columns with the second column being
three times as wide as the first.



[[working-with-asciidoctor-customizing-tables-title]]
==== Configuring the title

The title of a table can be specified using a line prefixed by a `.`:

[source,indent=0]
----
.Links <1>
\include::{snippets}/index/links.adoc[]
----
<1> The table's title will be `Links`.



[[working-with-asciidoctor-customizing-tables-title]]
==== Avoiding table formatting problems

Asciidoctor uses the `|` character to delimit cells in a table. This can cause problems
if you want a `|` to appear in a cell's contents. The problem can be avoided by
escaping the `|` with a backslash, i.e. by using `\|` rather than `|`.

All of the default Asciidoctor snippet templates perform this escaping automatically
use a Mustache lamba named `tableCellContent`. If you write your own custom templates
you may want to use this lamba. For example, to escape `|` characters
in a cell that contains the value of a `description` attribute:

----
| {{#tableCellContent}}{{description}}{{/tableCellContent}}
----
