== Customizing responses

There may be situations where you do not want to document a response exactly as received.
Spring REST Docs provides a number of response post processors that can be used to modify
a response after it is received but before it's documented.

Response modification is configured using a `ResponseModifier`. An instance can be
obtained using the static `modifyResponseTo` method on `RestDocumentation`. Once the
response modifications have been provided, documentation can be configured as usual
via the `andDocument` method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/ResponsePostProcessing.java[tags=general]
----
<1> Calls `modifyResponseTo` to configure response modifications, passing in one or more
`ResponsePostProcessor` implementations.
<2> Proceeds with documenting the call.


[[customizing-responses-pretty-printing]]
=== Pretty printing

`prettyPrintContent` on `ResponsePostProcessors` formats the body of the response to
make it easier to read.

[[customizing-responses-masking-links]]
=== Masking links

If you're documenting a Hypermedia-based API, you may want to encourage clients to
navigate the API using links rather than through the use of hard coded URIs. One way to do
this is to limit the use of URIs in the documentation. `maskLinks` on
`ResponsePostProcessors` replaces the `href` of any links in the response with `...`. A
different replacement can also be specified if you wish.

=== Removing headers

`removeHeaders` on `ResponsePostProcessors` removes any occurrences of the named headers
from the response.

=== Replacing patterns

`replacePattern` on `ResponsePostProcessors` provides a general purpose mechanism for
replacing content in a response. Any occurrences of a regular expression are replaced.
