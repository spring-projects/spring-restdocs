# REST Notes Slate

This sample shows how to document a RESTful API using Spring REST Docs and [Slate][1].
The sample can be built with Gradle, but requires Ruby and the `bundler` gem to
be installed.

## Quickstart

```
./gradlew build
open build/docs/api-guide.html
```

## Details

The bulk of the documentation is written in Markdown in the file named
[slate/api-guide.md.erb][2]. When the documentation is built, snippets generated by
Spring REST Docs in the [ApiDocumentation][3] tests are incorporated into this
documentation by [ERB][4]. The combined Markdown document is then turned into HTML.
