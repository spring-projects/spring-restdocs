# Spring REST Docs [![Build status][1]][2]

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to make it easy to document RESTful services by
combining content that's been hand-written using [Asciidoctor][3] with auto-generated
examples produced with the [Spring MVC Test][4] framework. The result is intended to be
an easy-to-read user guide, akin to [GitHub's API documentation][5] for example, rather
than the fully automated, dense API documentation produced by tools like [Swagger][6].

For a broader introduction see the Documenting RESTful APIs presentation. Both the
[slides][7] and a [video recording][8] are available.
